;;; https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/pascals-triangle
;;; For a given integer K, print the first K rows of Pascalâ€™s Triangle. Print each row with values separated by spaces. The value at nthrow and rth column of the triangle is equal to n! / (r! * (n-r)!) where indexing start from 0. These values are the binomial coefficients.
;;; 
;;; The Pascal Triangle
;;; 
;;; 1
;;; 1 1
;;; 1 2 1
;;; 1 3 3 1
;;; 1 4 6 4 1
;;; ....
;;; Input Format
;;; A Single Integer, K.
;;; 
;;; Constraints
;;; 
;;; 2 <= K <=10
;;; 
;;; And, you need to accomplish this without directly defining any local variables. For example, var and val have been blocked in Scala; def and defn are blocked in Clojure.
;;; 
;;; Output Format
;;; 
;;; The first K rows of the Pascal Triangle.

;;; Sample Input
